#**Personal Avengers Power Grid**

##**Introduction**

For this personal dataset project I decided to explore every offcial Avenger from the Marvel Universe. The intial data comes from comic vine.
I collected the data by reviewing character profiles and story summaries, paying special attention to descriptive keywords such as genius, superhuman, 
fast, enhanced, and similar terms that indicate a character’s abilities. These keywords helped identify which attributes a character possessed. I then examined specific 
feats mentioned in their histories to gauge the scale of those abilities. Using this information, I assigned numerical values to categories like speed, intelligence, strength, 
combat skills, and durability to create consistent power-level ratings across all characters.

##**Data Processing**

In order to carry out the analysis, I trimmed the categorical columns to remove the extra space after each letter so that the outputs were standardized to only ‘Y’ or ‘N’. 
I also calculated the average score for each character.
